Google cloud vs other cloud solutions for AI/machine learning  
I've looking for proper articles comparing the benefits of going with the GCP solutions instead of other cloud solutions like AWS, mainly around NLP but I'm having difficulties finding good comparisons and doing them my self since I am not as familiar with ML since I am a DevOps engineer.

>If price is a factor, check out https://gpu.land/. Our Tesla V100 instances are dirt-cheap at $0.99/hr. That's 1/3 of what you'd pay at GCP/AWS/paperspace!
>Bonus: instances boot in 2 mins and can be pre-configured for Deep Learning, including a 1-click Jupyter server. Basically designed to make your life as easy as possible:)

>One thing which most probably all cloud platform might suffer from is high prediction latency of the cloud ML server in comparison to your own model prediction server hosted on VMs on cloud. I personally saw it in GCP since I have only worked with GCP.

>I found aws and gcp to be similarly good when it comes to their SaaS offerings with Azure lacking behind. I like GCPs UI but their documentation is partially terrible. 

>Hi, at my company we are fan's of GCP. We find it friendly, except for the permissions part, which can be a nightmare the first time you face it.
