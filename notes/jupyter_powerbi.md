PowerBI reports could add new dimension in the visualization capabilities in jupyter notebook, I have tried to demonstrate in below post about how one can access their custom powerBI report inside jupyter notebook

# Comments section

Embedding in a Business application, cool and sometimes quite useful but embedding an Report within another reporting tool - yes I know jupyter is more than that - without interactions is pointless.

That's a good question, so far I have not seen any such possibilities, without any control over powerBI reports from jupyter notebook.

# Notes
- Method to integration BI visualization into notebook for easy display and integration with other results.
- Might be useful for git visualization

# Though:
- Worth giving it a try
