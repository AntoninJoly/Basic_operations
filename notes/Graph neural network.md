# Notes
- Graph Neural Networks are neural networks that operate on graph data.
- Grah data are a data representation that has vertex (nodes), edges (link) and global feature.
- Relational representation of data with geometric relational position.
- Image / text / molecule as graph data.

# Though:
- Might be useful for NLP application as the geometric position of word in a sentence influence its semantic meaning.
- Can be applied to context understanding for image data.
- Benefits over well established methods is not clearly explained.
- Might improve the performance of a system as the data dimension is clearly reduced.
- Not so much information. More details on graph data at https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/
- Applications might be wide but need to investigate some more content.
