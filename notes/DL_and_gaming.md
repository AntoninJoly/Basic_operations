Youtube video share about how to use AI in video games:
- Photorealistic neural rendering
- Deepfakes for gaming
- GAN theft auto and dreaming up game engines with neural networks
- Large language models for building realistic NPCs and storytelling
- Using OpenAI Codex to automatically program games.

# Comments section

>I imagine AI at least serving as a tool expanding the efficiency/reach of indie/solo devs. What today takes a whole studio might become feasible for a single person.-->

>I envision a game console with hardware level NN optimizations for photorealistic gaming within the decade. artists on the development side will have tools which are essentially just adjusting parameters of built in models. and background environments need not even be fully specified, instead they are generated from keywords and a seed... perhaps with a mask to be applied over a randomly generated map to limit the characters pathing.
>another fantastic invention i expect to see many years afterwards is dynamic music which matches beat and tone to what is currently happening in the game.

# Notes

- Video game industry is bigger that movies & music industries combined (revenue)
- DL play an important role for 3D games
- Graphics / gameplay / storytelling could be achieved by DL.
- Realistic image generation from sketch using GAN (change wetaher condition in an image e.g. snow)
- Photorealism to transform game engine output (GTA with cityscape dataset gives very realistic results)
&rarr; Thought: Lower game engine spec could be balanced with photorealistic model
- Game edition might be co-athoured by AI engineers and game developpers
- AI dungeon (text based fantasy world) makes it able to interact with command line to generate a story.
- Speech to text + text anaylsis + text to speech to generate gameplay or NPC interaction instead of pre-programmed reaction.

# Though:
- The Speech to text + semantic analysis + response generation + text to speech was the most impressive as you can customize interraction with NPC and make them much more realistic.
- GAN based solution need some more work as they lack of consistency.
- Photorealistic rendering is a good-to-go solution as far as you have dataset available (cityscape, kitti).
