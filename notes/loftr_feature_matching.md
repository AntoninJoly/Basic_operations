LoFTR: Detector-Free Local Feature Matching with Transformers

# Comments section

>The detector-free, dense matching approaches like LoFTR are really interesting and can be useful in certain contexts or applications.
>But in terms of matching accuracy and handling difficult image transforms, this way underperforms sparse detection and matching like superpoint/superglue when I did my own comparison.

>Just by looking at this video, it's not obvious that this is significantly better than something like SIFT or SURF


# Notes
- Gif file visualization is horrendous.
- Seems realtime capable.
- Similar to SIFT feature matching in appearance.

# Though:
