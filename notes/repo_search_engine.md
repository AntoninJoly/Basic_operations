# Post header 📝
I’ve made a search engine with 5000+ quality data science repositories to help you save time on your machine learning projects!  
I’ve been working in data science for 15+ years, and over the years, I’ve found so many awesome data science GitHub repositories, so I created a site to make it easy to explore the best ones.

# Comments section 👂🏻
well, the main advantage is the dynamic filtering of tags. This is a curated set of repos, so not every data science repo is included, but I'll work to include more!

# Notes ✍🏻
- A lot of different implementation in many domains.
- Advanced filter search (fork nmber, issue open, ...)

# Thoughts 💭
- Amazing tool but similar to wikipedia chain click issue.
