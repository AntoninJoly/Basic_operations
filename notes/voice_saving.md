How to save my father's voice?  
I was wondering if anyone knew of anything out there that use machine learning to capture his voice and generate new recordings. It would be great if it was something I could use in a text-to-speech engine. Not only could I have something to remember him by and share with my future children, but he could potentially use in a speech synthesizer so he can still speak in his own voice.

> I don't know the details, but my dad used some voice banking software to have a custom voice. I think it was through Tobii Dynavox, but I'm not sure. My dad didn't get around to doing this before his voice was too weak, so his cousin, who has a somewhat similar voice, agreed to do it for him. The software had my dad's cousin record many hours of audio reading certain things. I think it took him about a weekend. He could also choose other words and phrases to add beyond the standard set.

# Notes ✍🏻
- Microsoft tool seems to be working fine but we still need to use it from their platform.

# Thoughts 💭
- Commercial solution seems existent but open source are rarer.
- Getting data from video / audio is a must start.
