An opinion on the Free Energy Principle
It takes a really high effort to learn or implement, and the results so far, are far from practical.

"Free energy Principal" Seems to be a way to apply variational bayesian inference.

In the next decade there will be integration of subsymbolic AI with symbolic AI as each exceed the other in performance under opposing conditions. There are many things to improve upon the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) approach,aka. Neural Networks.

# Notes
- Fractal AI https://github.com/Guillemdb/FractalAI

# Though:
- A lot of theoretical work but very few implementation.
- Need to wait for implementation from researchers / specialists in the different domains.
